I've progressed from a senior software engineer to a software engineer manager. I'm learning how to build efficient teams to accomplish goals for a portfolio of projects. There are many struggles to overcome as a manager, and all of them lead to new lessons learned. I'm excited to see what I can accomplish with my team.
